= How to override front-end template or change callable function? =
 Just use a hook add_filter('wpfancybox3_front_template', your_function_name) in your functions.php file.
 Function take as param a template filename that now placed by path /wp-fancybox-3/templates/front.php
 Just copy this file in your template and return a new path in your function, for example:

add_filter('wpfancybox3_front_template', 'replace_wpfancybox3');
function replace_wpfancybox3($template) {
    return get_template_directory().'/my_own_template.php';
}

= How to override admin template? =
 Just use a hook add_filter('wpfancybox3_admin_template', your_function_name)
 with the same schema as described above.

= How to override styles? =
 Firstly, disable default styles in your functions.php file:
wp_deregister_style('jquery-fancybox');
 and after that you can use your styles file. If it placed in separated file instead your theme style.css use following code:
wp_enqueue_style('jquery-fancybox', get_template_directory_uri() . '/css/my_own_styles.css');
